Air Pollution Monitoring System
This is IOT based Air Pollution Monitoring System which measures indoor harmful gases present in air like Carbon Dioxide(CO2) using an MQ135 gas sensor and Carbon Monoxide(CO) using an MQ7 sensor. It will show the air quality in PPM(Parts Per Million) on the LCD and as well as on Thingspeak so that we can monitor it very easily in PPM.

Components Requirement:
Arduino Uno
Wi-Fi module Node-MCU ESP8266
16x2 LCD
MQ135 Gas sensor
MQ 7 LPG gas sensor
Buzzer
LEDs
