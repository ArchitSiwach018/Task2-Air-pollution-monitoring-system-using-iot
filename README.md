Air Pollution Monitoring System:-

This is IOT based Air Pollution Monitoring System which measures indoor harmful gases present in air like Carbon Dioxide(CO2) using an MQ135 gas sensor and Carbon Monoxide(CO) using an MQ7 sensor. It will show the air quality in PPM(Parts Per Million) on the LCD and as well as on Thingspeak so that we can monitor it very easily in PPM.

Components Requirement:
1. Arduino Uno
2. Wi-Fi module Node-MCU ESP8266
3. 16x2 LCD
4. MQ135 Gas sensor
5. MQ 7 LPG gas sensor
6. Buzzer
7. LEDs
